## Hi there 👋
I am Stanislav Raspechenko

After more than ten years as a technical specialist in engineering, I decided to retrain and completed a Data Scientist course. This is a very perspective field with a great opportunity to become a professional and to build a career. I am looking forward to apply my newly acquired knowledge, as well as strong analytical skills and technical thinking that I have developed during my previous work, to practical problems.

### Databases:
PostgreSQL

### Data Science:
Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, SciPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
